% Define what a self-stabilizing algorithm is and their applications.
% This will give an argument as to why they are necessary, why they
% are useful, and why a tool like this is warranted.
\input{sections/introduction}

% Run through the mathematical definitions of a graph, nodes/edges,
% and self-stabilizing algorithms.  In the last, stress the pairing of
% predicate and action functions.
\input{sections/mathematical-representation}

% Draw from the mathematical definitions and implement them in Python.
% In doing so, create the core classes.
\input{sections/logical-representation}

% Now we have the ability to logically manipulate graphs and
% algorithms.  Without an interface, however, we are still where we
% were.  Create an interface to compose an algorithm and argue the
% necessity and utility of each aspect.
\input{sections/interface-ssa}

% We have the ability to create algorithms, but nothing to test them
% on.  Introduce an interface to create graphs and import/export them
% to common formats.  This section is simply presentation; it needs no
% argument.
\input{sections/interface-graph-builder}

% We have algorithms and graphs to test them on, but nothing to
% facilitate the testing.  Introduce an interface to load algorithms
% and test with specific graphs (or those of an arbitrary degree).

\section{sandbox}
A sample citation: \autocites[26.1--26.45]{atallah2009algorithms}{Chen1991147}.

\autocite{Dijkstra:1974:SSS:361179.361202} says a lot about self-stabilizing algorithms.
