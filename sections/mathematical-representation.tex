A \gls{graph} is a mathematical construct
  consisting of \glspl{node} (or `vertices') and \glspl{edge} between them:
  \[ G = (V, E) \]

A self-stabilizing algorithm is a contruct composed of
  \glspl{predicate} and \glspl{action}.
Both are functions of graphs and vertices.
Predicates are functions to the Boolean values,
  where each action returns a new graph.
